Welcome to the 2025 EMBL Australia PhD Course: Introduction to R.

In this two hour session, we will cover the essentials of working with biological data in R, including:

* Importing and manipulating data

* performing simple dimension reduction

* Visualising gene expression using plots such as boxplots and heatmaps and carrying out basic statistical tests

* Building simple machien learning classifier

This workshop is designed for participants with little or no coding or bioinformatics experience.
We will work through the code together, and I encourage you to **type out all of the code yourself if possible**. Along the way, there will be a few short challenge exercises for you to try.
